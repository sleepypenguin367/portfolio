        <ul>
            <li><h3 class="para">All users started by pushing the button instead of touching the screen, even though the screen was big enough to be considered a touch screen. Users responded that choices are mapped with the button, and there are also arrows on the answer pointing to the button. The low resolution of the screen also gives them a sense that itâ€™s old enough not to carry these features. </h3></li>
            <li><h3 class="para">Two users responded that when paying, the machine asked for the type of card to pay with. They think that it is totally unnecessary since when they are using POS machines in other places, such as grocery stores, the POS machine can accept all cards without distinguishing them before swiping.</h3></li>
            <li><h3 class="para">All users agree that the pin pad is not covered. People can easily see when they are typing their pin. They had to cover them with their hands.</h3></li>
            <li><h3 class="para">When people have their first gas station experience, they often do not know which side their fuel tank is on. They do not know whether to plug in first or choose their gas type first. </h3></li>
            <li><h3 class="para">They also did not know that they could clip the button instead of keeping pushing to continually add fuel. They learned how to properly use the machine either by trying a few times or being taught by some experienced driver. </h3></li>
